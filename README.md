#Estimating Quantile Production Functions: A Control Function Approach
by Justin Doty and Suyong Song (2021)
## Abstract
We propose a new approach to estimate production functions in which output elasticities are heterogeneous across the conditional distribution of output. This paper extends the control function approach for estimating production functions to the conditional quantiles of firm production. Production function parameters are estimated in a simple two-stage approach which relies a location-shift assumption on unobserved productivity. We show that this method allows us to capture heterogeneity in output elasticities that may not be found in conditional mean estimates of [Ackerberg *et al.* (2015)](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA13408) or [Levinsohn and Petrin (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-937X.00246). We provide small-sample evidence in a Monte Carlo study to show that this approach is robust compared to other production function estimators. The method is applied to firm and plant-level manufacturing data from the U.S., Chile, and Colombia. The findings confirm that the proposed method captures unobserved heterogeneity in output elasticities.
